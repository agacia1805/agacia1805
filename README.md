👋 Hi, I’m Agata!
I am a junior frontend developer who also happens to be a book worm and a music addict. Welcome in my wonderland!🏰
This is my space for learning, maintaining and supervising my progress. I am currently learning: HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
I am looking forward to collaborate with other developers. If you have any interesting projects in mind, hit me up! 🦄
Just email me: agacia1805@gmail.com
