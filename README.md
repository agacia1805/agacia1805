👋 Hi, I’m Agata!
***
I am a junior frontend developer who also happens to be a book worm and a music addict. Welcome!🏰 
***
This is my space for learning, maintaining and supervising my progress. I am currently working on improving my JavaScript, React and TypeScript skills.
I am looking forward to collaborating with other developers. If you have any interesting projects in mind, hit me up! 🦄
